			<p class="subhead"> The Architecture of Large-Scale Information Systems </p>
			<p class="proname">Fast Convergence PageRank in Hadoop: </p>       
			<p class="projectintro">Compute PageRank in MapReduce for a reasonably large web graph using a direct node-by-node approach. Initial input and final output are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) files and Amazon Elastic MapReduce(Amazon EMR) is used to manage the several MapReduce passes.
            To improve the convergence rate, compute PageRank in MapReduce for the same web graph using a Blocked Matrix Multiplication in which the number of MapReduce passes is reduced by doing nontrivial computation in the reduce steps. </p>

			<p class="subhead"> Systems Security </p>
			<p class="proname">Secure Auction Marketplace:</p> 
			<p class="projectintro">Build a security-optimized system using Java on linux based system for auction-based electronic commerce.</p>
            

			<p class="subhead"> Software Engineering </p>
			<p class="subhead"> Web Design </p>
			<p class="subhead"> Machine Learning </p>
			<p class="subhead"> Computer Vision </p>
		
		<p class="category">MEng Project</p>
		
			<p class="subhead">Computer Vision with Kinect Sensors</p>
			<p class="projectintro">Wrote a C++ program using OpenCV, Point Cloud Library, Kinect SDK to fuse depth maps of a scene acquired from multiple Kinect sensors to realize 3D scene reconstruction
            Programming on GPU to detect and match features in parallel in order to achieve real-time 3D scene reconstruction</p>
		
		<p class="category">Undergraduate Projects</p>
		
			<p class="subhead">Formation Control of Nonholonomic Mobile Robots</p>
			<p class="projectintro">Simulated the performance of the Formation Control algorithm using a MATLAB platform
            Used C++ language in the Formation Control Experiment Team to control one leader robot to run in a circle trajectory while three other robots follow the leader robot in the desired formation</p>

			<p class="subhead">Cognitive Radio Communication Verification System</p>
			<p class="projectintro">Researched a spectrum sensing algorithm for a signal processing module and proposed an improved cooperative spectrum sensing method based on the random matrix theory considering different positions of cognitive radios
            Simulated the performance of the improved method and compared it with other methods using a MATLAB platform</p>
